To implement the two-level scheduling algorithm with fixed priority preemptive scheduling in level 1 and shortest remaining time first (SRTF) scheduling in level 2, we can follow the below methodology:

1. Define a Process class with attributes such as name, arrival time, burst time, priority, and remaining time.

2. Implement the lt method to compare two processes based on their priority values.

3. Define a function called two_level_scheduling to implement the two-level scheduling algorithm. This function should accept a list of Process objects as an argument.

4. Create two priority queues, q1 and q2, to store the processes in level 1 and level 2, respectively.

5. Add all the processes to q1.

6. Initialize time to 0 and current_process to None.

7. Loop until q1 and q2 are empty and the current_process is None.

8. If q1 is not empty, get the next process with the highest priority from q1.

9. Check if there is a current_process. If yes, compare its priority with the next process from q1.

10. If the priority of the next process is higher than the current_process, preempt the current_process, and enqueue it in q2.

11. If the priority of the next process is lower than or equal to the current_process, continue executing the current_process.

12. Execute the current_process for 2 units of time.

13. Update the remaining time of the current_process.

14. If the remaining time of the current_process is 0, add it to the completed_processes list and set current_process to None.

15. If the remaining time of the current_process is not 0, enqueue it in q2 and set current_process to None.

16. If q1 is empty and there is no current_process, get the next process with the shortest remaining time from q2.

17. Execute the current_process for 1 unit of time.

18. Update the remaining time of the current_process.

19. If the remaining time of the current_process is 0, add it to the completed_processes list and set current_process to None.

20. Repeat steps 8 to 19 until all processes are completed.

21. Return the completed_processes list.

22. Generate a list of processes with random attributes such as name, arrival time, burst time, and priority.

23. Call the two_level_scheduling function with the list of processes as an argument.

24. Print the name of all completed processes.
